    (1) Understanding data types: integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets. 
    (2) Python variables and memory allocation. 
    (3) Python operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise.


-- > Understanding Data Types :

     * Integer: integer data type store all numbers, positive or negative.  
     * Float:   float data type stroe all Numbers with decimal points.  
     * String:  string store Sequence of characters like  = "car" .  

--> Python Variables and Memory Allocation :

      *  Variables store data values and reference memory locations dynamically allocated during runtime.

--> Python Operators :

         * Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical operations like +, -, *, //.

         * Comparison Operators: Compare values, e.g., ==, !=, <, >.

         * Logical Operators: Combine conditions using and, or, not.
            
         * Bitwise Operators: Perform bit-level operations like &, |, ^, ~. """
