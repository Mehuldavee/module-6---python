"""
* Understanding the role of break, continue, and pass in Python loops.

break:
           * Purpose: Exits the loop entirely.

           * One-liner to remember: break stops the loop completely.

continue:
           * Purpose: Skips the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.

           * One-liner to remember: continue statement skips the rest of the current iteration.

pass:

          * Purpose: Acts as a placeholder; does nothing when executed.
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        pass  # Does nothing for i == 3
    else:
        print(i)  # Output: 0 1 3 4
onr-lineer to remember : pass does nothing and is used as a placeholder.
